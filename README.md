### Project Descriptions

#### [MRDC Educational Practices Quantitative Analysis](https://github.com/davidalmonte9/portfolio/tree/master/MRDC%20Educational%20Practices%20Quantitative%20Analysis)
* Project uses survey results and student test scores from a 2016 evaluation study of 103,670 students in over 30 schools. Teacher implementation practices for the Common Core State Standards are of special interest to policy makers, who may wish to institutionalize practices known to improve student performance.

#### Housing Price Prediction
* Nothing too complex: uses multiple regression analysis, ANOVA, F-tests of joint significance to assess the relative importance of housing valuation determinants. Implications for housing stock investment, arbitrage opportunities, are contextualized against prevalining research on housing economics. 

#### Taxi Tip Machine Leaning Models
* Leverages cloud computing techniques, feature design in SQL and Pandas, machine learning methods, and multiple data sources to cluster taxi tipping practices into groups. Special discussion is reserved for the implications of the use of demography, geolocation information for business practice.

#### Sequential Frequency Analysis of Victorian Literature - Frankenstien and Wuthering Heights
